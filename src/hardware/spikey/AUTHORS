The PyNN backend for the Spikey neuromorphic system was originally created in 2010 at Electronic Vision(s) Group,
Kirchhoff-Institute for Physics, Ruprecht-Karls-Universität Heidelberg,
Germany.

Here is an inevitably incomplete list of MUCH-APPRECIATED CONTRIBUTORS --
people who have submitted patches, reported bugs, added translations, helped
answer newbie questions, and generally made this PyNN backend for the Spikey neuromorphic system that much better:

    Anne-Christine Scherzer
    Bernhard Kaplan
    Bernhard Vogginger
    Daniel Brüderle
    David Stöckel <david.stoeckel@kip.uni-heidelberg.de>
    Eric Müller <mueller@kip.uni-heidelberg.de>
    Johannes Bill
